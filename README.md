# CanIFish - Intelligent Fishing Conditions Dashboard

An advanced HTML dashboard that displays real-time water conditions and provides intelligent fishing condition analysis for the Chattahoochee River near Norcross, GA (USGS Station 02335000).

## Features

### 🎣 Intelligent Fishing Conditions
- **Smart Background Colors**: Visual indicators for fishing conditions
- 🟢 **Green**: Excellent fishing conditions (Low turbidity, normal water level, low streamflow, no recent dam generation)
- 🟠 **Orange**: Caution conditions (Good water quality with recent dam generation or elevated streamflow)
- 🔴 **Red**: Poor fishing conditions (High water levels, high streamflow, or extended dam generation)
- **Real-time Analysis**: Automatically evaluates turbidity, gage height, and dam generation patterns
- **Condition Notifications**: Floating indicators with specific fishing advice

### 🏗️ Dam Generation Integration
- **USACE Data**: Real-time Buford Dam generation schedules
- **Generation Tracking**: Monitors power generation levels and duration
- **Change Predictions**: Shows upcoming generation schedule changes
- **Historical Analysis**: Tracks generation patterns over time

### 📊 Enhanced Data Visualization
- **Summary Cards**: Quick overview of key parameters with trend indicators
- **Trend Analysis**: 3-hour trend arrows showing parameter direction
- **Rate of Change**: Average change per hour over the last 3 hours with stability, rising, and falling cues
- **Interactive Filters**: Toggle visibility of different data categories
- **Temperature Units**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit

### 🌊 Comprehensive Water Data
- Real-time water condition data from USGS API
- Displays detailed measurements for each available parameter
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Modern, clean interface with dynamic backgrounds

## Fishing Condition Logic

### Green Background (Excellent Fishing)
- Turbidity < 10 NTU for past hour **AND**
- Gage Height < 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Streamflow < 1000 ft³/s for past hour **AND**
- No dam generation ≥ 5 MW recorded in the last 14 hours

### Orange Background (Caution)
- Turbidity < 10 NTU for past hour **AND**
- Gage Height < 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Streamflow < 1000 ft³/s for past hour **AND**
- Dam generation ≥ 5 MW occurred within the last ~4.5 hours
  
  **OR**

- Turbidity < 10 NTU for past hour **AND**
- Gage Height < 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Streamflow between 1000 and 2999 ft³/s for past hour

### Red Background (Poor Fishing)
- Gage Height ≥ 4 ft for past hour **OR**
- Streamflow ≥ 3000 ft³/s for past hour **OR**
- Dam generation ≥ 5 MW is active or was recorded within the last 14 hours

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The dashboard will automatically:

1. Fetch real-time water condition data from USGS API
2. Retrieve current dam generation schedules from USACE
3. Analyze conditions and apply intelligent fishing recommendations
4. Display comprehensive data with trend analysis
5. Auto-refresh all data every 5 minutes

## Data Sources

### USGS Water Services API
- **Site**: 02335000 (Chattahoochee River near Norcross, GA)
- **Data Period**: Last 24 hours
- **Update Frequency**: Every 15 minutes
- **Parameters**: Flow, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, gage height

### USACE Dam Generation Data
- **Dam**: Buford Dam/Lake Sidney Lanier
- **Data**: Real-time and scheduled power generation
- **Update Frequency**: Hourly
- **Coverage**: Current day and next day schedules

## Parameters Displayed

The dashboard shows comprehensive water quality and operational parameters:
- **Stream Flow**: Discharge rate in cubic feet per second
- **Gage Height**: Water level in feet
- **Water Temperature**: Current temperature with trend analysis
- **Turbidity**: Water clarity measurement
- **pH Levels**: Water acidity/alkalinity
- **Dissolved Oxygen**: Oxygen content in water
- **Dam Generation**: Power output from Buford Dam in megawatts

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Uses the Fetch API for HTTP requests
- Responsive CSS Grid layout
- Error handling for network issues
- Multiple CORS proxy fallbacks for API access
- Demo data mode when live API is unavailable
- Progressive web app manifest with favicons and platform icons for better installability

## CORS Issues & Solutions

The USGS API doesn't allow direct browser access due to CORS restrictions. The dashboard includes several solutions:

1. **CORS Proxies**: Tries multiple proxy services automatically
2. **Demo Mode**: Shows realistic sample data when API is unavailable
3. **Local Server**: For best results, serve from a local web server

### Running with a Local Server

For reliable API access, serve the page from a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have it)
npx serve .

# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

## Browser Compatibility

Works with all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 JavaScript features
- Fetch API
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

## Local Development

No build process required. Simply:

1. Clone or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. The dashboard will load automatically
