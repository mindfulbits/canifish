## Fishing Condition Logic

### Green Background (Excellent Fishing)
- Gage Height ≤ 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Turbidity ≤ 8 NTU for past hour **AND**
- Streamflow ≤ 1000 ft³/s for past hour


### Orange Background (Caution)
- Gage Height ≤ 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Turbidity between 8 and 9 NTU for past hour
  **OR**
- Gage Height ≤ 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Streamflow between 1000 ft³/s and 3000 ft³/s for past hour
  **OR**
- Gage Height ≤ 4 ft for past hour **AND**
- Dam generation ≥ 5 MW is active or was recorded within the last 6 hours


### Red Background (Poor Fishing)
- Gage Height > 4 ft for past hour **OR**
- Turbidity ≥ 9 NTU for past hour **OR**
- Streamflow ≥ 3000 ft³/s for past hour
