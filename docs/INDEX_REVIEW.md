# CanIFish `index.html` Review

## Summary
- **Overall** Comprehensive single-page dashboard with rich hydro data that must remain in a flat-file footprint. Maintainability, accessibility, and performance still need attention within a no-build constraint.

## Highlights
- **UI Polish** Strong visual design using gradients, shadows, and iconography that conveys a premium dashboard feel.
- **Data Resilience** Multiple fallback proxies in `loadWaterData()` and `loadUSACEData()` increase the chance of a successful fetch.
- **State Persistence** LocalStorage saves user toggles, preserving filters, temperature units, and section visibility across visits.

## Opportunities
- **File Organization** Split the inline CSS and JavaScript into standalone `styles.css` and `app.js` files referenced from `index.html`. This preserves a static workflow while improving readability and enabling browser caching of assets.
- **Modular JavaScript (Lite)** Inside `app.js`, structure the code into self-contained sections (e.g., IIFE modules for `api`, `state`, `ui`). Use comments and function exports to simulate modularity without requiring a bundler.
- **Error Handling UX** Enhance the `#error` banner with actionable copy (e.g., which proxy failed, suggested retry interval) and debounce repeated failures to prevent flashing overlays.
- **Accessibility** Add semantic containers such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `aria-live` regions for updates. Replace custom toggles with native `<input type="checkbox">` elements styled via CSS, and ensure focus management after calling `scrollToTable()`.
- **Responsiveness** Introduce additional media queries (e.g., 1024px, 600px) to adjust grid column counts, table layouts, and control spacing. Provide visible horizontal scroll hints for wide tables on small screens.
- **Performance** Lazy-render heavy sections by updating only changed DOM nodes in `displayTable()`. Extract fetched data parsing into cached structures to avoid recomputing on every UI refresh.
- **Content Strategy** Credit proxy services in a dedicated footnote, provide quick glossaries for measurement units, and add skeleton/loading placeholders for `summary-cards` and `generation-tables` during fetches.
- **Data Validation** Guard against empty `series.values` before indexing, and display fallback text like “Awaiting data” instead of `N/A`. Capture fetch exceptions with `console.warn` plus a timestamp for easier debugging.
- **Testing** Maintain a manual smoke-test checklist (e.g., verify filters, temperature toggle, proxy fallbacks) that can be run in the browser without tooling, and consider adding lightweight unit tests via `<script type="module">` only when manually triggered.

## Suggested Next Steps
- **Prioritize** Externalize CSS/JS into separate files, tighten DOM updates in `displayTable()`, and document proxy attribution within `index.html`.
- **Quick Wins** Add semantic landmarks, convert toggles to native inputs, inject loading skeletons, and expand media queries for mid-size breakpoints.
- **Longer Term** Explore a simple serverless proxy or scheduled cache job to reduce reliance on third-party CORS proxies while keeping deployment lightweight.
